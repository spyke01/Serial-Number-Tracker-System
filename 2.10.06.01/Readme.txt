Description:
------------------------------------------
This system allows for easy creation and management of license numbers, serial, numbers, asset numbers, and much more. This system can also double as an asset tracker, allowing you to know where all of your equipment is. You can easily add more administrators to the program, so each of your employees can add new numbers or create users(only administrators can create users).  

All questions and comments are welcome, email me at sales@fasttracksites.com

Installation:
----------------------------------
Extract the files to your web directory.
Chmod _db.php to 777
Fill out all of your information and submit the form.
Delete install.php
Chmod _db.php to 755
Enjoy!

Editing Database Connection Settings:
------------------------------------------ 
In rare cases, the installer will be unable to create the _db.php file correctly, this is usually because of the file not being chmodded correctly.

If this happens, you will need to manually edit _db.php for your db settings.
